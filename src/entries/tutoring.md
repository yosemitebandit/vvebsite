I've been tutoring with CollegeTrack in SF for a few months now.
Thought I'd keep a log of some memorable moments.

Worked with one student on some unit circle problems.
He had a really good memory for all of the coordinates,
said he memorized it because he was tired of taking home his worksheet, haha.

I was asked to help with bio once -- specifically the Krebs Cycle.
Krebs was one of those topics that I never really mastered in high school
but we gave it a go and I think we made some good progress.
What was so infuriating though was hearing that the teacher didn't make any sort of effort on this topic.
Students were given a worksheet and told to teach themselves in groups.
There wasn't even a lecture or a chance to ask questions.
Is this a case of a teacher not really knowing their material?
Total speculation, but I'll bet that happens.

Got an appreciation for helping with kinematics, that was a good feeling.
Kolena really cemented that stuff in..

I remember helping at the English table once on a language classification assignment.
Well, I guess it was grammar.
I can't quite remember but I think we were mapping direct and indirect objects,
something along those lines.
What I distinctly remember was my exasperation and my student's frustration at the assignment.
The result, knowing the classification of some noun, seemed pointless.
Or at least, I had no idea how to connect it to writing.
And getting there, doing the actual work of classification, was not built on any clear rules.
