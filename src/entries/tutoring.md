I've been tutoring with CollegeTrack in SF for a few months now.
Thought I'd keep a log of some memorable moments.

Me and K got all riled up about the Second Industrial Revolution.
The wealth of Carnegie,
the injustice of price-fixing trusts,
the funny confusion over monopoly and polygamy,
more mixups with labor unions and the unions-of-the-north..
She was really quick and curious, comparing Marxism and vertical integration.
I was rapidly out of my depth but it was fun.

Worked with A on his geometry problems.
He had really good recall for all of the unit circle coordinates,
said he memorized it because he was tired of taking home his worksheet, haha.

I was asked to help with bio once -- specifically the Krebs Cycle.
Krebs was one of those topics that I never really mastered in high school
but we gave it a go and I think we made some good progress.
What was so infuriating though was hearing that the teacher didn't make any sort of effort to teach Krebs in class.
Students were given a worksheet and told to teach themselves in groups.
There wasn't even a lecture or a chance to ask questions.
I mean, it's the Krebs Cycle..not really self-explanatory stuff.
Is this a case of a teacher not really knowing their material?
Total speculation, but I'll bet that happens.

Got an appreciation for helping with kinematics, that was a good feeling.
Kolena really cemented that stuff in..

I remember helping at the English table once on a language classification assignment.
Well, I guess it was grammar.
I can't quite remember but I think we were mapping direct and indirect objects,
something along those lines.
What I distinctly remember was my exasperation and my student's frustration at the assignment.
The answers to the problems, knowing the classification of some noun, seemed pointless.
Or at least, I had no idea how to connect it to writing.
And getting there, doing the actual work of classification, was not built on any clear rules.
