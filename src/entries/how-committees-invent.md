 * "Given any design team organization, there is a class of design alternatives
which cannot be effectively pursued by such an organization
because the necessary communication paths do not exist."
 * "there is a very close relationship between the structure of a system
and the structure of the organization which designed it" (in fact they're identical)
 * "It is an article of faith among experienced system designers
that given any system design, someone someday will find a better one to do the same job."
(hah, no irony here either, I think)
 * "To the extent that an organization is not completely flexible in its communication structure,
that organization will stamp out an image of itself in every design it produces."
 * and then a perhaps cynical, but certainly interesting take on managing systems
which concludes that communication in large teams disintegrate, and so, qed,
large systems themselves disintegrate
 * "Because the design which occurs first is almost never the best possible,
the prevailing system concept may need to change. Therefore, flexibility of organization is
important to effective design."
