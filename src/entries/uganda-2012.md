While working for [Aquaya](http://aquaya.org) I spent a busy few weeks in
Maputo and Beira.

Technical assistance background and the 1M Initiative.

Work with Matteus, Delfim and Sergio.

Other observations - the lumber camps, the rural areas, the resources, the rent,
seeing the presidential results come back
