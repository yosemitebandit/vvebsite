In the middle of my [trip to Mozambique](/mozambique)
I flew briefly to Uganda to help with a conference Aquaya was putting on.

Unfortunately didn't meet up with Kenneth or Ignitius.

Did see Roey and toured his awesome office.
Heard of his amazing plans with husk power.
..Saw James Bond which mentioned Uganda to everyone's delight.
