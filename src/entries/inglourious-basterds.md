It had its moments.
I liked the running joke about bad accents.
The movie star's "English with a touch of German" seemed pretty forced,
especially in the bar scene when they were fixated on the accents of the imposter officers. 
And the botched Italian was kinda funny too.

I did enjoy Waltz.
Why did his character kill the movie star?
And he seemed to recognize Shoshana (he ordered milk for her) 
so was he planning to defect all along?
More wikipedia-ing is in store..
