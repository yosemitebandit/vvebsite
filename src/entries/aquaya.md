I was a Program Associate at Aquaya from February 2012 to February 2013,
working primarily on their new-ish information communication and technology initiatives.

started working on the Aquatest data collection systems
interviewing operators in Cambodia and Vietnam..
working further with HueWACO
IVRHub for Cambodia
further prototyping with UNICEF-Mozambique

grants with E, M, J, B, I, 
consulting with SP
more work with UNICEF-Mozambique
paper
UNC presentations

left because I wanted to be able to do more technical work
than the program could offer
