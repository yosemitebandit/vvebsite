* there was once this [phlogiston theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory) --
phlogiston being an element allegedly released during combustion
* thinking around 'complex systems' isn't a paradigm shift, says downey,
these modeling techniques are just becoming more acceptable, they won't replace classical formulations
* these results are often simulation-based rather than analyis-based
* also trend from continuous math to discrete
* mentions the four-color theorem was proved in the 70s
