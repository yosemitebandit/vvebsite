A film to get lost in.
To reflect on the worlds you've built and the lives you've led.
The people you've known and loved and how you think of them, project to them.
What would happen if we could progressively distill our lives?
Or maybe it's about our constant, simplifying reflections on our experiences.

I enjoyed the paintings and the recursed maps.
The singer in the bar and the box office.
The girl in the green jacket who would be missed.
