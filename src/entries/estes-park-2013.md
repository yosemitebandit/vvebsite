---

stayed for a few days in Estes Park with about 20 other folks
this was just a few days after leaving my job at Aquaya
we talked about various puzzles and challenges we're all facing

I asked about whether I should consciuosly focus on a sector
rather than bouncing from project to project as I do now
got some good feedback too -- 

I especially liked meeting some of the slightly older folks -- 
lots of great role models, of sorts.
People who lead very successful and well-balanced lives,
while also dealing with a lot of challenges in their lives.
